## Overview

The Door Status Detector uses a basic HTML structure to display the door status. The state of the door (open or closed) is fetched from a server endpoint (`/status`) every second, and the UI is updated accordingly. The door image and the background color of the header, footer, and status box change based on whether the door is open or closed.

## Features

- **Real-Time Door Status:** The UI updates every second with the current status of the door.
- **Visual Feedback:** The door image and the background colors change based on the door's status.
- **Responsive Design:** The interface is designed to work on different screen sizes.
